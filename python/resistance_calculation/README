Resistance Calculations
What is the resistance of the pneumotach and any extensions?

Standardised requirements for Spirometer are in Miller et al. 2005
Total resistance is <1.5 cmH2O for Q = 14 L/s

_________________________
Have data from Spirometer
Data records:
    *pressure across pneumotach
    *flow
    *pressure relative to atmosphere

Find resistance of pneumotach for expected flow rates of tidal breathing.
Know pressure and flow -> solve for resistance = P/Q

Find resistance of additions
Total pressure - pneumotach pressure = extension pressure
(Extension pressure only includes additions after pneumotach)
resistance in same way

Total resistance found using total pressure drop
